# Final_Project
* Cleaning the sex column - dealing with NA and different names in the column
* Cleaning the dates column
* Creating a line graph for avgSqUnits by month for each sex
* Couldn’t figure out how to create line graphs for each state - partially because not every state had data for each month
* In the ladybug data, couldn’t get x-axis in graph of species by month to correctly scale
* There was to many points in the scatterplot for wing length and wing width by state. 
* states were overlapping eachother in graphs
